# Simple Home Accounting

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/borsini/simple-home-accounting.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/borsini/simple-home-accounting)



> This project aims to simplify everyone's day-to-day accounting. It provides a simple web based serverless application.

For years I have use complex or closed source sofwares to do this simple task. I wanted :
- to do my accounting quickly and everywhere
- to be independant of my bank application or any of the commercial apps
- to use an uber simple and long-lasting file format that I could open  in 20 years from now

One day I came across [ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org/), a cool text file format quite popular among the geek community. It is part of what we call [plain text accounting](http://plaintextaccounting.org). I decided to write a UI on top of it and voilÃ  :)

## Features

> The current version is raw and full of small bugs. Mainly because it just suits my needs :D

- Import any of your existing .ledger, .ofx, .gnucash files
- Add / edit / remove transactions
- Export your transactions as a .ledger file
- [Soon] Generate charts to get some statistics

If you're curious, you can check the [backlog](https://github.com/Benlenem/ledger-charts/projects).

## Test it

A running version of the app is hosted [here](https://simple-home-accounting.web.app/). I personally use it to do my accounting.</br>You can use it too and any feedback would be kindly appreciated !
